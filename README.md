### Hi there 👋

<br />
<p>
I graduated in 2023 from the department of computer engineering. I like to continuously enhance my skills in this field. My introduction to software occurred during my time at university, and I developed a deep affection for it. I am proficient in using Java, C, C#, Arduino, HTML, CSS, and PHP. I am an active voluntary contributor to a website focused on information technology. Additionally, I voluntarily engaged with a company to further my growth and gain practical experience.
I have actively participated in various seminars and camps to broaden my knowledge within my field. Holding an IOT1929 Professional Certificate, I have demonstrated my expertise in the realm of the Internet of Things. Notably, I designed a voice-command-operated spray machine using Arduino, showcasing my innovative problem-solving abilities and technical skills.
My involvement extends to the realm of SEO, and I have also undertaken a project utilizing the MVC architecture.
As a dedicated professional, I continue to seek opportunities to expand my horizons and contribute to technological advancements.
